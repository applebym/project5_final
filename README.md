# Project 5 - Fashion-Forward Image Search

This repo contains code for my fifth and final project at Metis, a data science bootcamp in NYC. For this project, I developed a clothing image search tool using tensorflowâ€™s neural networks for image classification, the opencv library for feature extraction and k-means and k-nearest neighbors to cluster similar images. <br /> <br />

**project_code**: contains code for image search tool <br />
**output_graph.pb**: tensorflow output file for trained neural network <br />
**output_labels.txt**: tensorflow output file for trained neural network <br />
**shopstyle.py**: python wrapper for Shopstyle API <br />
