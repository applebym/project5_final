# project5_final

This repo contains code for my fifth and final project at Metis, a data science bootcamp in NYC. For this project, I developed a clothing recommendation tool using tensorflowâ€™s neural networks for image classification, the opencv library for feature extraction and k-means and k-nearest neighbors to cluster similar images.
